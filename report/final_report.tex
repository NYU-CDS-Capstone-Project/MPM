% \documentclass[10pt,journal,compsoc]{../sty/IEEEtran}


% For Computer Society journals, IEEEtran defaults to the use of

% (uncomment the ones you want to load)



% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % The IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later.





% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage{acronym}
% acronym.sty was written by Tobias Oetiker. This package provides tools for
% managing documents with large numbers of acronyms. (You don't *have* to
% use this package - unless you have a lot of acronyms, you may feel that
% such package management of them is bit of an overkill.)
% Do note that the acronym environment (which lists acronyms) will have a
% problem when used under IEEEtran.cls because acronym.sty relies on the
% description list environment - which IEEEtran.cls has customized for
% producing IEEE style lists. A workaround is to declared the longest
% label width via the IEEEtran.cls \IEEEiedlistdecl global control:
%
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\IEEEsetlabelwidth{SONET}}
% \begin{acronym}
%
% \end{acronym}
% \renewcommand{\IEEEiedlistdecl}{\relax}% remember to reset \IEEEiedlistdecl
%
% instead of using the acronym environment's optional argument.
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/acronym


%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/mdwtools


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/eqparbox




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.


% NOTE: PDF thumbnail features are not required in IEEE papers
%       and their use requires extra complexity and work.
%\ifCLASSINFOpdf
%  \usepackage[pdftex]{thumbpdf}
%\else
%  \usepackage[dvips]{thumbpdf}
%\fi
% thumbpdf.sty and its companion Perl utility were written by Heiko Oberdiek.
% It allows the user a way to produce PDF documents that contain fancy
% thumbnail images of each of the pages (which tools like acrobat reader can
% utilize). This is possible even when using dvi->ps->pdf workflow if the
% correct thumbpdf driver options are used. thumbpdf.sty incorporates the
% file containing the PDF thumbnail information (filename.tpm is used with
% dvips, filename.tpt is used with pdftex, where filename is the base name of
% your tex document) into the final ps or pdf output document. An external
% utility, the thumbpdf *Perl script* is needed to make these .tpm or .tpt
% thumbnail files from a .ps or .pdf version of the document (which obviously
% does not yet contain pdf thumbnails). Thus, one does a:
% 
% thumbpdf filename.pdf 
%
% to make a filename.tpt, and:
%
% thumbpdf --mode dvips filename.ps
%
% to make a filename.tpm which will then be loaded into the document by
% thumbpdf.sty the NEXT time the document is compiled (by pdflatex or
% latex->dvips->ps2pdf). Users must be careful to regenerate the .tpt and/or
% .tpm files if the main document changes and then to recompile the
% document to incorporate the revised thumbnails to ensure that thumbnails
% match the actual pages. It is easy to forget to do this!
% 
% Unix systems come with a Perl interpreter. However, MS Windows users
% will usually have to install a Perl interpreter so that the thumbpdf
% script can be run. The Ghostscript PS/PDF interpreter is also required.
% See the thumbpdf docs for details. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at.
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/thumbpdf


% NOTE: PDF hyperlink and bookmark features are not required in IEEE
%       papers and their use requires extra complexity and work.
% *** IF USING HYPERREF BE SURE AND CHANGE THE EXAMPLE PDF ***

%\usepackage[\MYhyperrefoptions,pdftex]{hyperref}
%\else
%\usepackage[\MYhyperrefoptions,breaklinks=true,dvips]{hyperref}
%\usepackage{breakurl}
%\fi
% One significant drawback of using hyperref under DVI output is that the
% LaTeX compiler cannot break URLs across lines or pages as can be done
% under pdfLaTeX's PDF output via the hyperref pdftex driver. This is
% probably the single most important capability distinction between the
% DVI and PDF output. Perhaps surprisingly, all the other PDF features
% (PDF bookmarks, thumbnails, etc.) can be preserved in
% .tex->.dvi->.ps->.pdf workflow if the respective packages/scripts are
% loaded/invoked with the correct driver options (dvips, etc.). 
% As most IEEE papers use URLs sparingly (mainly in the references), this
% may not be as big an issue as with other publications.
%
% That said, Vilar Camara Neto created his breakurl.sty package which
% permits hyperref to easily break URLs even in dvi mode.
% Note that breakurl, unlike most other packages, must be loaded
% AFTER hyperref. The latest version of breakurl and its documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/breakurl
% breakurl.sty is not for use under pdflatex pdf mode.
%
% The advanced features offer by hyperref.sty are not required for IEEE
% submission, so users should weigh these features against the added
% complexity of use.
% The package options above demonstrate how to enable PDF bookmarks
% (a type of table of contents viewable in Acrobat Reader) as well as
% PDF document information (title, subject, author and keywords) that is
% viewable in Acrobat reader's Document_Properties menu. PDF document
% information is also used extensively to automate the cataloging of PDF
% documents. The above set of options ensures that hyperlinks will not be
% colored in the text and thus will not be visible in the printed page,
% but will be active on "mouse over". USING COLORS OR OTHER HIGHLIGHTING
% OF HYPERLINKS CAN RESULT IN DOCUMENT REJECTION BY THE IEEE, especially if
% these appear on the "printed" page. IF IN DOUBT, ASK THE RELEVANT
% SUBMISSION EDITOR. You may need to add the option hypertexnames=false if
% you used duplicate equation numbers, etc., but this should not be needed
% in normal IEEE work.
% The latest version of hyperref and its documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/hyperref





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\IEEEPARstart{P}{article} physics experiments generally seek to estimate fundamental constants of nature. These constants can be measured with varying levels of uncertainty, depending on the choice of experimental parameters. Our project is designed to demonstrate a proof-of-concept for automating the identification of the experimental parameters which minimize the uncertainty associated with measurement of the quantity of interest in the experiment. This proof of concept can be extended to real physics simulations.

This "robot physicist" system can be understood using the simple analogy of two experimenters, Alice and Bob. Alice runs experiments which generate data, and she uses the data to update her prior on the distribution of the natural constant of interest. Bob uses the posterior from Alice's experiment to run a set of simulated experiments with various possible experimental settings, and he identifies the experimental settings that maximize the expected information gain. Bob then hands the best experimental settings back to Alice, and Alice repeats the process.

\subsection{Notation}
The experimental model has three main components: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\phi$ : Experimental configurations such as the energy required to run the particular experiment.
\item $\theta$: Quantities that we would like to infer from the experiment
\item $X$: Data generated from the experiment
\end{enumerate}

\section{Proof-of-Concept Model}

\subsection{Black-box}
For our proof-of-concept we use a black-box simulator which generates data, $X$, such that $X$ follows a univariate Gaussian distribution with mean $\theta$ and variance $2 + \cos(\phi)$. This proof-of-concept would hold for any black box, but  this configuration was chosen for convenience, as $\phi$ is unconstrained, and variance is always non-negative. This black-box serves three purposes.
\begin{enumerate}
\item purpose 1 
\item purpose 2
\item purpose 3
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Algorithm}
\begin{algorithm}
 \KwResult{estimate $\theta_{true}$ and $\phi_{real}$ }

 \While{iter $<$ num iters }{
	$P(\theta_{pos})$ = \texttt{gen\_theta\_posterior($\theta_{true}$, $\phi_{real}$, $P(\theta)_{prior}$)}\;
    $P(\theta_{prior}) = P(\theta_{pos})$\;
    $\phi_{real}$ = \texttt{optimize\_phi($\theta_{prior}$, $H(\theta)$)}\;
 }
\caption{Main algorithm}


    \underline{function \texttt{gen\_theta\_posterior}} ($\theta$, $\phi$, $P(\theta)_{prior}$)\;
    $X$ = \texttt{black\_box($\theta$, $\phi$)}\;
    $P(X | \theta, \phi) $ = \texttt{likelihood(X, $\theta$, $\phi$)}\;
    \Return \texttt{normalize($P(\theta)$ $\times$ $P(X | \theta, \phi) $}\;
%    	\caption{Generate posterior distribution on theta}

	\underline{function \texttt{optimize\_phi}}($P(\theta)$, $H(\theta)$\;

%     \caption{Optimize choice of Phi}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Generate a posterior distribution on theta}
This step contains two notable processes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Computing the likelihood of $X$ given $\theta$ and $\phi$:

We generate an empirical pdf using a normalized histogram with samples generated from the black-box using $\theta$ and $\phi$.
\item Finding an appropriate step size for $\theta $

Given an lower- and upper-bound for theta (which should be available for most physical constants of interest), and, for convenience, using a univariate Gaussian distribution, $\sigma_{theta_{posterior}}$, which scales as $\frac{\sigma_{theta_{prior}}}{\sqrt{n}}$, with $n$ = the number of samples used to compute the likelihood.
\end{enumerate}
After calculating these components, the computation of the posterior is trivial.

\subsubsection{Optimize phi}

We use the following simplifications to optimize over $\phi$  in our toy model.

\begin{enumerate}
\item We use a greedy procedure in which we compute the information gain for a set of plausible $\phi$ 's (experimental settings) and we return the $\phi$ that maximizes the expected information gain.
\item  For a fixed value of phi, we approximate $\int P(X|\Phi) (H[P(\theta)]-H[P(\theta|X,\Phi)])$ $\, dX$  with $H[P(\theta)] -    \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N H[P(\theta|X_i,     \Phi)])}{N}$  where $N$ is the number of times the experiment is carried out with the same experimental settings.
\item To estimate the integrated expected information gain, we need to integrate $H[P(\theta|X,\Phi)]$  over $\theta$. We in-turn replace this integration with a point-estimate using the MAP estimate of P($\theta)$  \end{enumerate}


\section{Improvements and Extensions}
\subsection{Improvements to the toy model implementation}
\subsubsection{Likelihood-free inference}
Our toy model demonstrates the case where $X$ is a univariate gaussian. For multi-dimensional $X$ , we can replace the usage of histograms with likelihood-free inference techniques to compute $P(\theta | X, \phi)$ 

\subsubsection{Bayesian optimization}
Currently we optimize over $\phi$  by choosing a range of values with a fixed step size. The optimization over $\phi$ is a technique that very naturally fits into a bayesian optimization framework since the function that computes the expected information gain is a very expensive function that includes many simulator calls. 

\subsubsection{Bobs choice of $\theta$} 
Computing the expected information gain using the MAP estimate of $\theta$  could be replaced by computing the mean information gain by sampling from the posterior.


\subsection{Extension to a real physics simulator}
\subsubsection{Integrating a physics experiment simulator}
We can connect our toy data pipeline to a real physics experiment simulation developed by Lukas Heinrich (\url{https://github.com/lukasheinrich/higgs-mc-studies}). The experiment takes has $\phi$ = (sqrtshalf, polbeam1, polbeam2), and it generates experimental data (events) as json.
\subsubsection{Extension for Likelihood-free inference}
For the actual simulated experiments, the ground truth is not known, and this proof of concept can be extended to make use of a likelihood-free inference toolbox (\url{https://github.com/diana-hep/carl}) to estimate $P(X | \theta, \phi)$ . 
\subsubsection{Scaling the proof-of-concept to large experiments}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Caching: 
\item Parallelism: 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Bayesian motivation}
We indicate with $x$ the data that is the output of the experiment. This output depends on $\theta$ (that represent a constant of nature) and $\Phi$ (that represent the setting to the experiment). We call $P(x|\theta,\Phi)$ the probability distribution of the data given $\theta$ and $\Phi$. Using Bayesian theory we can compute the posterior of $\theta$ given $x$ and $\Phi$ as follow:
\begin{equation}
P(\theta|x,\Phi)=\frac{P(x|\theta,\Phi)P(\theta|\Phi)}{P(x|\Phi)}
\end{equation}
When $\Phi$ varies this distribution changes and so does the uncerainty on the mesure of $\theta$. The goal is to find the value of $\phi$ that generate a distribution with the smallest possible uncerainty. To do that we define the information gain as a function of $\phi$ and than we find the value of $\phi$ that maximizes it. The information gain is definde as:
\begin{equation}\label{infGain}
EIG(\Phi) =\int P(x|\Phi)\Big[ H[P(\theta)]-H[P(\theta|x,\Phi)]\Big]dx
\end{equation}
where we indicated with $H$ the entropy. We approximate it discretizing the distribution on $theta$, as:
\begin{equation}
%H[P(\theta)]=-\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}p(\theta)\log p(\theta) d\theta
H[P]\simeq-\sum_{k\geq 1}p_k \log{p_k}
\end{equation}
To compute that we need to sample from $ P(x|\Phi)$ and know $P(\theta|x,\Phi)$.
\begin{itemize}
\item We don't have $P(x|\Phi)$ because the data of the experiment is conditioned on $\theta$ as well, consequently we can only sample from the distribution $P(x |\theta,\Phi)$. But we can calculate it using the following:
\begin{equation}
P(x|\Phi) = \int P(x,\theta | \Phi)d \theta = 
\int P(x| \theta , \Phi) P(\theta | \Phi)d \theta 
%= E[P(x| \theta , \Phi)]
\end{equation}
Where the last equality is the expected value of $P(x| \theta , \Phi)$ under the distribution $P(\theta | \Phi)$.
Discretising the integral:
\begin{equation}
P(x|\Phi) \simeq \sum_{i=1}^{n}  P(x |\theta_i,\Phi)P(\theta_i | \Phi) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}  P(x |\theta_i,\Phi) 
\end{equation}
Where in the last equality we are assuming to have an uniform distribution $P(\theta_i | \Phi) =1/n$.
We use the black box to generate the distributions $P(x |\theta_i,\Phi) $ for $n$ values of $\theta$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ll}
\theta_1 \rightarrow P(x |\theta_1,\Phi)\\
\theta_2 \rightarrow P(x |\theta_2,\Phi)\\
\dots\\
\theta_n \rightarrow P(x |\theta_n,\Phi)\\
\end{array}
\end{equation}
each of these distribution is obtained from a histogram of the sampled data.
Using these we can compute $P(x|\Phi)$. \\

Since $P(x | \Phi)$ is now discretized because of the histogram, we sample from a multinomial with the parameters, $x_i$'s given by the bin centers and the probability computed from the normalized histogram.

This is done from lines 92 to 107 in the code.

\item To calculate the posterior $P(\theta|x_j,\Phi)$ where $x_j$ is sampled using the method described above, we can use Bayes theorem:
\begin{equation}
P(\theta|x_j,\Phi)=\frac{P(x_j|\theta,\Phi)P(\theta|\Phi)}{P(x_j|\Phi)}
\end{equation}

\item After doing this, we average out $-H[P(\theta|x_j ,\Phi)]$ across all $x_j$'s to calculate the Expected Information Gain.
\end{itemize}


\section{results}
\subsection{Toy model}
We ran the toy model with $\theta_{true}=1.0$ and we scanned $\theta$ in the range from $-3$ to $3$ with $200$ steps. Then we loop over the possible values of $\phi$ in the range $\phi = 2+w$ with $w$ in $(0-2\pi)$. In the set of Figures from \ref{fig:LP0} to \ref{fig:LP5} we report the plots of the posterior for different value of $w$.

We have designed a proof-of-concept for a robot physicist system which is capable of searching for the experimental settings which most effectively measure a quantity of interest. We demonstrated a working example of the system using toy data, we outlined next steps to improve the toy model, and proposed next steps for scaling the model to real physics simulations.
